"""Run provenance capture: what produced a result, and can it be reproduced.

A console scrollback is not a record. This module snapshots everything needed to
reproduce — or later cite — a training run: the code state it executed against,
the environment it ran in, a fingerprint of the exact data it consumed, and the
metrics it produced. The result is a JSON manifest written beside the
human-readable console report.

Three fields carry most of the weight and are easy to underestimate:

- ``DatasetFingerprint.sha256`` pins the *bytes* of the feature matrix. A file at
  a stable path is not a stable input; rebuilding or repairing it silently
  invalidates every number previously attributed to it.
- ``GitState.dirty``/``diff`` records uncommitted work. Citing a commit hash for a
  run that executed against modified files is simply false, and runs during active
  development are almost always dirty.
- ``Provenance.packages`` pins the libraries. XGBoost and scikit-learn change
  defaults across releases, so the same code and data can drift over time.
